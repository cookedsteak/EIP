/**
 * A contract that serves as the fa√ßade to the entire suite of contracts to support an UDAP-based application
 *

 An UDAP app uses this interface to manage all the assets: users, financial ledgers, state channels, asset as tokens, ownership transfers, important events, audit logs.

 An instance of Udapp is deployed when an application is registered with UDAP for a specific supported
 public chain, such as the Ethereum main chain.

 Major modules:

 1. finance: security bond, accounting with UDAP, payable/receivable
 2. user management: user/app state channels
 3. user asset management: asset tokenization, asset trading.

 This interface is inteded to be used by UDAP node via client API.
