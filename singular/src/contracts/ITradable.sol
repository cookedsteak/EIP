 * @title Interface of tradable ISingular
 *
 * It supports:
 * 1. simple transfer
 * 2. swap between singulars
 * 3. buy and sell
 * 4. auction (todo)
 *
 *
 *
 *  XXX: Ideally it should inherit from ISingular, but doing so causes remix IDE compiler to complain
 * about order of definitions. As a compromise, I added the toISingular() to bridge the two interface.
