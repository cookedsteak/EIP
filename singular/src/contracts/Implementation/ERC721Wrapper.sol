/*
 @title A singular that wraps an ERC721 token


 Two strategies for this to interoperate with 721 contracts:

 1. The 721 token owner must be assigned to an instance of this contract. Ownership actions
 must be delegated to this, The 721 contract must NOT maintain a separate internal state for
 ownerships.

 Or:

 2. This contract is used as a wrapper to the underlying 721 contract. All function invocation
 must be forwarded to the 721. The 721 handles the canonical state changes. The owner of a 721
 token is assigned to an OwnerOfSingulars, which is maintained in the 721.

 The following implementation is specially designed for working the open-zeppelin 721 which is
 a 721 centered model as described in strategy 2.
